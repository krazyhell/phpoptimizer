# Copy Path Feature in PHP Optimizer HTML Reports

## Overview

The HTML reports generated by PHP Optimizer now include a "Copy Path" button for each problematic file. This feature allows users to quickly copy the file path of any file with detected issues to the clipboard, with robust clipboard fallback and visual feedback.

## How It Works

- Each problematic file in the HTML report has a "Copy Path" button next to its path.
- Clicking the button copies the file path to the clipboard.
- If the browser does not support the Clipboard API, a fallback method is used (temporary input selection and copy command).
- Visual feedback is provided: the button text changes to "Copied!" for 1.5 seconds after a successful copy.
- No debug or console logs are present in the JavaScript.
- File paths are normalized for Windows compatibility (backslashes).

## Technical Details

- The feature is implemented in the HTML report template in `reporter.py`.
- JavaScript is included in the report to handle the copy action and fallback.
- The button is accessible and works in all modern browsers.

## Usage

1. Run the analyzer to generate an HTML report:
   ```sh
   python -m phpoptimizer analyze examples/ --recursive --output-format html --output report.html
   ```
2. Open the generated `report.html` in your browser.
3. Click the "Copy Path" button next to any problematic file to copy its path.

## Notes
- No debug or console logs are present in the generated HTML/JS.
- The feature is available in all HTML reports generated after June 2025.
